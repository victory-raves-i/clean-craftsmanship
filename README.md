# CLEAN CRAFTSMANSHIPT

This repo is intended for executing all the exercises that appear on the book called _clean craftsmanship_. Also the idea is learning `go` along the process.

## QUEUE

Implement a FIFO queue of integer following TDD.

### FIFO Principle

The first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed.

### Two Ends

A queue has a distinct front (or head) for removals and a rear (or tail) for additions.

### Operations

- Enqueue: Adds an element to the rear of the queue.
- Dequeue: Removes and returns the element from the front of the queue.
- Peek: Returns the element at the front without removing it.
- isEmpty: Checks if the queue contains any elements.
- Size: Returns the number of elements currently in the queue.
